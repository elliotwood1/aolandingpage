            <p>With a Smeg built-in oven, you can master all your family favourites.
                Wave goodbye to juggling different dishes and cooking times at the Sunday roast with Circulaire.
                It evenly circulates heat inside to prevent flavours transferring between your
                sweet and savoury creations. Cleaning afterwards will be a breeze too thanks to
                Smeg’s automatic programmes. Burn food and grease splatters to ash inside with the
                Pyrolytic setting, or steam them away with powerful Vapour Clean technology.

        <p>Keep ingredients as fresh as the day you bought them with Smeg’s range of stylish
            fridges and freezers. The Plus Blu Light inside the fridge extends the life of your
            fruit and vegetables, helping you enjoy fresher, tastier food for longer.
            If you’re stocking up for a dinner party, the Multizone compartment is ideal,
            as you can use it as either a fridge or freezer drawer. Plus, thanks to No Frost technology,
            cool air is constantly circulating inside to prevent icy build-ups, which means
            you’ll never have to defrost the freezer again!
